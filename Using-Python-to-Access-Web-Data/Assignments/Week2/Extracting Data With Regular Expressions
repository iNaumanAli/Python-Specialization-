#Assignment Description
In this assignment you will read through and parse a file with text and numbers. You will extract all the numbers in the file and 
compute the sum of the numbers.
The basic outline of this problem is to read the file, look for integers using the re.findall(), looking for a regular expression of 
'[0-9]+' and then converting the extracted strings to integers and summing up the integers.
Solution is in the Jupyter Notebook, Named Regex-Solution.
